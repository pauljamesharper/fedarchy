# Omadora — Quattro

A concise, beginner-friendly guide to install Omadora on **Fedora Asahi Remix (aarch64)** for Apple Silicon Macs M1/M2

> ### 🆕 This is Omarchy "Quattro"
> This branch tracks **Omarchy quattro** — a major rework of the desktop. The bar, launcher,
> notifications, and OSD (waybar / walker / mako / swayosd) are replaced by a single **Quickshell**
> shell, and all Hyprland config — including every keybinding — moves to **Lua** (`.conf` → `.lua`).
> **→ See [QUATTRO-CHANGES.md](QUATTRO-CHANGES.md) for the full list of what changed.**

_This project is an extension of [Omarchy Mac](https://github.com/malik-na/omarchy-mac) project._

## Before you begin

Requirements:

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2 family)
- **Fedora Asahi Remix 44 Minimal (aarch64) or newer**
- A regular user with sudo access
- Internet connectivity
- `git` installed

Unsupported targets:

- Arch/Asahi Alarm runtime paths
- Non-Asahi Fedora installs
- x86_64
- **Fedora Asahi Remix 43 and older** - see below

Checklist:

- [ ] Backup completed
- [ ] Fedora Asahi device compatibility checked
- [ ] Running Fedora Asahi Remix 44 or newer (`cat /etc/os-release`)
- [ ] Fedora Asahi first-boot TTY setup completed (language, hostname, time, root password, user, wheel)
- [ ] Internet connected
- [ ] Sudo user ready

---

**Important:** Fedora Asahi Minimal first boot lands in a TTY setup flow. You must complete all prompts there before running Omadora installer steps.

---

### Prepare Fedora Asahi Minimal (required)

Fedora Asahi Minimal always starts with a TTY setup flow. Complete all prompts there before continuing:

- language
- hostname
- date/time
- root password
- regular user creation
- wheel/sudo access

Do not continue to Omarchy install until all first-boot setup actions are complete.

Optional: improve TTY readability

```bash
sudo dnf install -y terminus-fonts-console || sudo dnf install -y terminus-fonts
sudo setfont ter-v22n
```

---

## Connect to Wi-Fi before installation

Use one of these methods from your Fedora Asahi session before running the installer.

Use `nmcli` (NetworkManager CLI):

```bash
# Check network devices
nmcli device status

# Connect to a network
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID_NAME" password "PASSWORD"
```

The connection you make here carries over into the installed system: the installer leaves
NetworkManager on its default `wpa_supplicant` backend and does not touch saved profiles.

Fedora Asahi Minimal normally includes the required first-boot setup prompts; use these commands only to ensure networking is ready before install.


### Install Omadora

As your regular sudo user;


Clone and run the installer:

```bash
sudo dnf update
git clone https://github.com/malik-na/omadora.git ~/.local/share/omarchy
cd ~/.local/share/omarchy
bash install.sh
```

`omarchy update` pulls from wherever you cloned, so a fork installs and updates from that fork
without any extra configuration.

---

## Post-install tasks

- Reboot and log into your Hyprland session.
- Press `Cmd + K`  to learn all the Keybindings. 
- Validate core desktop behavior: app launcher opens, terminal keybind works, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth menus open, and lock screen works.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### Installer refuses to continue

The installer currently supports **Fedora Asahi Remix on aarch64 only**. Verify distro/architecture and rerun.

On **Fedora Asahi Remix 43 or older** the installer, `omarchy-update` and `omarchy-migrate` all stop on purpose and print the upgrade steps. Upgrade Fedora to 44 first - see [Already on Fedora Asahi Remix 43?](#already-on-fedora-asahi-remix-43) above.

### Session launches but keybinds fail

Run this to confirm Omarchy commands resolve in your login shell:

```bash
bash -lc 'echo "$PATH"'
bash -lc 'command -v omarchy-menu omarchy-cmd-terminal-cwd uwsm-app'
```

---

## Update and maintenance

- `Menu > Update > Omarchy` pulls the Omarchy repository, runs any pending migrations, and updates Fedora packages (`dnf upgrade --refresh`).
- It also covers what `dnf` cannot reach: the `--user` Flatpak apps (Obsidian, Moonlight), the npx-wrapped CLI tools, and the mise runtimes. `DEPENDENCIES.md` lists every external source and the mechanism that updates it.
- Update availability is tracked as git divergence from your configured upstream branch.

Check branch/upstream state:

```bash
git -C ~/.local/share/omarchy status -sb
```

## Fedora Sway Atomic / secureblue: update pipeline fix

On a secureblue (Fedora Sway Atomic, hardened) machine, `Menu > Update > Omarchy` failed
immediately with `sudo: command not found` while "Updating time..." was printing. secureblue
ships no `sudo` at all (privilege escalation goes through `run0` instead) and shadows the host
`dnf` (package changes route through `rpm-ostree`/flatpak/brew), so two scripts in the update
pipeline that assumed a mutable-Fedora `sudo dnf` world broke outright:

- `bin/omarchy-update-time` called `sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd` unconditionally.
- `bin/omarchy-update-system-pkgs` called `sudo dnf upgrade -y --refresh` / `sudo dnf autoremove -y`
  unconditionally.

Both now branch on `is_secureblue`/`is_ostree` (from `install/helpers/distro-secureblue.sh` and
`install/helpers/packages.sh`, the same helpers the rest of the codebase's secureblue migrations
already use): `omarchy-update-time` picks `run0` or `sudo` for the escalation, and
`omarchy-update-system-pkgs` goes through the existing `omarchy_update_system` abstraction, which
resolves to `rpm-ostree upgrade -y` on any OSTree deployment and to `sudo dnf upgrade` elsewhere;
the `dnf autoremove` step is skipped on OSTree, which has no equivalent concept.

Because both checks are automatic, these two scripts already do the right thing on plain Fedora
Sway Atomic (non-secureblue, still `sudo`-capable) with no edits needed there. What genuinely
still needs porting: a large number of other `bin/omarchy-*` scripts call `sudo` directly and
haven't been run through this same `is_secureblue`/`is_ostree` check yet, so other commands can
still hit the same "sudo: command not found" failure on secureblue until they're updated the same
way (see the `migrations/*.sh` files for the established pattern).

This fix was scoped and applied by Claude Code from a screenshot of the failing update dialog and
a plain-language description of the problem, in one interactive session. The reporter's own
review of the change was "vibe coded" — accepted on the strength of the explanation and a
successful test run, not independently verified line by line — so treat this section as
unverified until it's been confirmed on a second secureblue machine.
