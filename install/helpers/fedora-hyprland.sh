# Hyprland core package selection for Fedora aarch64.
#
# lionheartp/Hyprland is the only aarch64 source for the compositor: Fedora proper ships hyprlang and
# hyprutils, but no hyprland, aquamarine or uwsm. Its stable `hyprland` package is built once per
# release, so when the COPR rebuilds hyprutils/aquamarine across an soname bump, stable stops
# resolving until it is rebuilt too. hyprland-0.55.4 was built 2026-06-11 against libhyprutils.so.12
# and libaquamarine.so.11; the 2026-07-18 library rebuilds moved those to .13 and .12 and left
# stable uninstallable.
#
# hyprland-git is rebuilt from git daily against the current libraries, so it covers those windows.
# The two packages conflict, so exactly one is ever installed.
#
# The uwsm session file is in a separate subpackage on both sides - hyprland-uwsm and
# hyprland-git-uwsm - and each is only a Recommends, not a Requires. Both are installed explicitly
# here rather than left to weak dependencies, because install/login/sddm.sh points SDDM at the
# hyprland-uwsm session and silently falls back to the plain hyprland session when that .desktop is
# missing. A machine installed with install_weak_deps=False would otherwise get the wrong session.
#
# Stable is always preferred. This runs from the installer and from omarchy-update-manual-pkgs, so a
# machine parked on hyprland-git returns to stable on its own as soon as the COPR ships a working
# build - the user never has to do anything. The compositor swap is a single dnf transaction: dnf
# resolves it fully before touching any package, so an attempt made while stable is still broken
# fails without disturbing the working hyprland-git install. Only once that has succeeded is the
# session subpackage swapped, because the two subpackages own the same .desktop path and would
# collide if both were installed.

# secureblue: same stable/git selection and swap logic as below, but every
# install/swap is an rpm-ostree layer that only takes effect on the *next*
# boot - `rpm -q` here still reflects the currently booted deployment, not
# a pending one, so re-running this script before rebooting is a safe
# no-op (the pending change is already queued) and re-running it after
# rebooting picks up wherever the swap left off. `rpm-ostree install
# X --uninstall Y` is the atomic-swap equivalent of `dnf swap Y X` - one
# transaction, resolved fully before anything is written, same safety
# property as dnf's swap.
